# Super-Mario-Inspired-Game 
I took a Super-Mario-inspired game that my professor made and added two characters (a dove and a strawberry), an enemy (in the form of a balloon), and a powerup (an orb that changes the music to a lofi-version of the soundtrack from the animated show Avatar: The Last Airbender). Programmed in Java for my first-semester computer science course's final project.
